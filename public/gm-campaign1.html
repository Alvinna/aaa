	  <h1 id="campaign-1">Campaign 1</h1>
  <h2 id="story">Story</h2>
  <h2 id="missions">Missions</h2>
  <p>MISSION 1: a human ship engineer (Siri) on the planet Pygmalion
  (IOS, majority automaton) reported suspicions of a coworker planning
  to steal engine tech - meet her and investigate</p>
  <p>Ship will have legal status everywhere from Presidium but
  transponders didn‚Äôt update before attempting to get to planet</p>
  <p>Shoot through (they should disable not destroy) and land on
  surface, ship will leave, party will be found by security vehicles
  (steal them, leave the cops stranded or take them along)</p>
  <p>Get to city, find coffee shop where engineer requested a discreet
  meeting (party will be heavily armed and scare off everyone)</p>
  <p>Get details from Siri (witnessed another human engineer Wheatley
  with two security cards, investigated on her own and found deleted
  call logs and duplicated clearances)</p>
  <p>At this point cops arrive (Captain Carrigan, Ellakian woman),
  relationship depends on the party‚Äôs actions so far</p>
  <p>Either way, Carrigan takes them seriously (persuade, or appeal to
  council) and asks them all to help prevent heist</p>
  <p>The clues will indicate involvement of DOS (D of Standards)
  Wheatley‚Äôs apartment is bombed as a result of the party‚Äôs lack of
  stealth, they should conclude that the thieves are going ahead more
  violently as they know they are compromised</p>
  <p>Strategies to stop heist: idk ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
  <p>Generally: party makes a good plan and has good relation with
  security, less enemies to fight</p>
  <p>Otherwise it will be more difficult</p>
  <p>Heist will start - while party is fighting henchmen, Galatea will
  attack security hq and may hurt Carrigan or Siri - decide whether to
  split up and help (should do this or fight is more difficult without
  backup)</p>
  <p>No one sees Galatea personally, she will leave in getaway vehicle
  (a ship that was specially modified by Wheatley) with or without
  engine tech</p>
  <p>Black hat captives will tell party her last name, their reason for
  stealing tech (not trusting the monopoly of automaton led IOS)</p>
  <p>Council will tell party to pursue Galatea but for now no leads,
  maybe Siri tells them about black hat priestess who is in self imposed
  exile, may be willing to give info</p>
  <p>MISSION 2: Head to a backwoods planet called Terminus, where mostly
  humans live, attempting to preserve the old ways of Earth</p>
  <p>A lot of anachronisms, no communication tech, they‚Äôve intentionally
  forgotten about aliens and space travel over hundreds of years</p>
  <p>The black hat priestess Cordelia is an Ellakian woman who arrived
  here and has unwittingly gained a cult following from the humans who
  believe she has the power of God</p>
  <p>A young man named Herod is unconvinced by the mystical thinking and
  wants to understand their history, and what technology Cordelia
  possesses</p>
  <p>They will investigate Cordelia‚Äôs actions, and try to figure out
  what she‚Äôs searching for here</p>
  <p>The Termites have a biocompatibility device developed hundreds of
  years ago to make human compatible molecules out of the local
  organisms</p>
  <p>Cordelia suspects that the technology behind it was too expensive
  and forgotten due to terraforming efforts but later adopted by
  NovaLife</p>
  <p>The crew and Herod will help Cordelia prevent a mass destruction
  event with her ‚Äúmagic‚Äù</p>
  <p>When asked about the heist, Cordelia will say she doesn‚Äôt know
  much, only that there was some discord within the black hats when she
  left ten years ago, and she suspects that hard liners from that
  faction were involved with both the heist and NovaLife</p>
  <p>MISSION 3: NovaLife and heist on backburner, new council mission -
  putting down a rebellion against the Presidium endorsed leader of the
  planet Kuranto</p>
  <p>Automaton named Caroline</p>
  <p>The Presidium invokes its power through financial pressure rather
  than military force - however, the slow resource draining of Kuranto
  has started an uprising large enough that the Presidium requires
  military action</p>
  <p>The crew should mediate - try to thread needle between preventing
  violent uprising and actually harming civilians</p>
  <p>Things will come to a head - Caroline will order the crew to attack
  a civilian target (presumably they refuse) and Caroline will have
  hired a mercenary ship that she sends to fight</p>
  <p>Galatea‚Äôs ship will appear halfway through the fight and kill the
  mercenaries, and broadcast to the planet that they need to throw off
  the Presidium‚Äôs shackles</p>
  <p>Whitaker will order them not to pursue or act against her - the
  Presidium needs to discuss how to deal with her</p>
  <p>MISSION 4: Istrian member of crew will receive a request to help a
  distant relative</p>
  <p>She is in a relationship with a white hat woman and they are being
  hunted by extremists</p>
  <p>This is a lie - they have stolen AI based technology from the black
  hats and are being pursued by the black hats and another party</p>
  <p>The crew will be captured by the Dai Sun, leader is an Istrian male
  who wants the tech himself</p>
  <p>Kill him (difficult)</p>
  <p>The white hat woman will reveal its actually just translator tech
  (but AI based!) And will let crew member duplicate it</p>
  <p>MISSION 5: Daedalus recruits crew to hunt down the Renegade,
  illegally working with the Black Hats to obtain specialized hardware
  and attain immortality Will find a robot body (ship AI will ask for
  it) Bring Renegade back to Daedalus on the Lagrange Ark. He tells
  party about automaton history then decides to retire himself with the
  Renegade</p>
  <p>MISSION 6: NovaLife mission - Galatea makes herself known</p>
  <p>Female human scientist with modifications (chromatophores, night
  vision, solar power) believes in the work but does not know about the
  experiments NovaLife has done</p>
  <p>MISSION 7: Galatea offers transponder change and freedom</p>
  <p>MISSION 8: Pirate attack and boarding</p>
