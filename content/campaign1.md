The Presidium, the collection of the galaxy's powers that be, agreed not to field a standing navy. But they have other ways of keeping the peace - you. You are the unofficial crew of an unofficial ship; your mandate is to protect the fragile detente among four species and innumerable factions, by whatever means you choose - wits, discretion, a light touch or brute force. You can help those in trouble, challenge the unjust, or put the very galaxy under your thumb. Choose your missions, your companions, and your approach - but choose wisely. The political machinery of a hundred worlds is shifting - and you might end up at the wheel, or ground between the gears.
