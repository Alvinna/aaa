# Species

## Allakians
### most recently discovered sentient species, purposefully reshaped themselves as human adjacent based off of human-derived signals, most human presenting individuals lose the ability to perform major shape shifting, they will have chosen aesthetic features and limited reshaping abilities; also they are purple

## Anthropoid 
### human peeps - may choose biological or technological modifications, within limits

## Astrians
### giant plantlike starfish, many limbs, extremely resilient. They talk to each other via complex chromatophores, translators so far are low tech making it difficult for them to communicate with other species
### also new space travel tech (eggs) designed based off their biology, to withstand massive g forces

## Automaton
### AI revolution centuries ago, accompanied by the breakdown of the internet and the deaths of most advanced AI researchers
### SECRETLY the automatons chose to enforce rules on themselves, only one body, no mind transfer, and no creation of "new people"
### automatons return to the home planet once their drives are full (approximately a human lifespan) and have their memories erased, becoming new selves without designing new AIs
