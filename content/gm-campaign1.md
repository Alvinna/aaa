# Campaign 1 

## Story

## Missions

MISSION 1: a human ship engineer (Siri) on the planet Pygmalion (IOS, majority automaton) reported suspicions of a coworker planning to steal engine tech - meet her and investigate

Ship will have legal status everywhere from Presidium but transponders didn't update before attempting to get to planet

Shoot through (they should disable not destroy) and land on surface, ship will leave, party will be found by security vehicles (steal them, leave the cops stranded or take them along)

Get to city, find coffee shop where engineer requested a discreet meeting (party will be heavily armed and scare off everyone)

Get details from Siri (witnessed another human engineer Wheatley with two security cards, investigated on her own and found deleted call logs and duplicated clearances)

At this point cops arrive (Captain Carrigan, Ellakian woman), relationship depends on the party's actions so far

Either way, Carrigan takes them seriously (persuade, or appeal to council) and asks them all to help prevent heist

The clues will indicate involvement of DOS (D of Standards) Wheatley's apartment is bombed as a result of the party's lack of stealth, they should conclude that the thieves are going ahead more violently as they know they are compromised

Strategies to stop heist: idk ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

Generally: party makes a good plan and has good relation with security, less enemies to fight

Otherwise it will be more difficult

Heist will start - while party is fighting henchmen, Galatea will attack security hq and may hurt Carrigan or Siri - decide whether to split up and help (should do this or fight is more difficult without backup)

No one sees Galatea personally, she will leave in getaway vehicle (a ship that was specially modified by Wheatley) with or without engine tech

Black hat captives will tell party her last name, their reason for stealing tech (not trusting the monopoly of automaton led IOS)

Council will tell party to pursue Galatea but for now no leads, maybe Siri tells them about black hat priestess who is in self imposed exile, may be willing to give info


MISSION 2: Head to a backwoods planet called Terminus, where mostly humans live, attempting to preserve the old ways of Earth

A lot of anachronisms, no communication tech, they've intentionally forgotten about aliens and space travel over hundreds of years

The black hat priestess Cordelia is an Ellakian woman who arrived here and has unwittingly gained a cult following from the humans who believe she has the power of God

A young man named Herod is unconvinced by the mystical thinking and wants to understand their history, and what technology Cordelia possesses

They will investigate Cordelia's actions, and try to figure out what she's searching for here

The Termites have a biocompatibility device developed hundreds of years ago to make human compatible molecules out of the local organisms

Cordelia suspects that the technology behind it was too expensive and forgotten due to terraforming efforts but later adopted by NovaLife

The crew and Herod will help Cordelia prevent a mass destruction event with her ‚Äúmagic‚Äù

When asked about the heist, Cordelia will say she doesn't know much, only that there was some discord within the black hats when she left ten years ago, and she suspects that hard liners from that faction were involved with both the heist and NovaLife

MISSION 3: NovaLife and heist on backburner, new council mission - putting down a rebellion against the Presidium endorsed leader of the planet Kuranto

Automaton named Caroline

The Presidium invokes its power through financial pressure rather than military force - however, the slow resource draining of Kuranto has started an uprising large enough that the Presidium requires military action

The crew should mediate - try to thread needle between preventing violent uprising and actually harming civilians

Things will come to a head - Caroline will order the crew to attack a civilian target (presumably they refuse) and Caroline will have hired a mercenary ship that she sends to fight

Galatea‚Äôs ship will appear halfway through the fight and kill the mercenaries, and broadcast to the planet that they need to throw off the Presidium's shackles

Whitaker will order them not to pursue or act against her - the Presidium needs to discuss how to deal with her

MISSION 4: Istrian member of crew will receive a request to help a distant relative

She is in a relationship with a white hat woman and they are being hunted by extremists

This is a lie - they have stolen AI based technology from the black hats and are being pursued by the black hats and another party

The crew will be captured by the Dai Sun, leader is an Istrian male who wants the tech himself

Kill him (difficult)

The white hat woman will reveal its actually just translator tech (but AI based!) And will let crew member duplicate it

MISSION 5: Daedalus recruits crew to hunt down the Renegade, illegally working with the Black Hats to obtain specialized hardware and attain immortality
Will find a robot body (ship AI will ask for it)
Bring Renegade back to Daedalus on the Lagrange Ark. He tells party about automaton history then decides to retire himself with the Renegade

MISSION 6: NovaLife mission - Galatea makes herself known

Female human scientist Ashra with modifications (chromatophores, night vision, solar power) believes in the work but does not know about the experiments NovaLife has done

Expansionists from the Presidium are about to terraform a new world - crew is sent to provide security for Ashra as she tries to preserve life forms and useful genetics

The Natural Order's extremist members are trying to destroy the terraformers and kill Ashra as well, crew should protect her

Galatea will come in to prevent the terraforming efforts and make an ally of the Natural Order, while also seeking to kidnap Ashra and extract information from her


MISSION 7: Galatea offers transponder change and freedom

MISSION 8: Pirate attack and boarding
