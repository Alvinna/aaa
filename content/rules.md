# Rules


## Character stats
* Dexterity (Reflexive/Graceful)
* Charisma (Persuasive/Assertive)
* Strength (Aggressive/Forceful)
* Inteligence (Calculating/Methodical)
* Discovery (Inquisitive/Exploratory)

Assign +2, +1, +1, 0, -1 to the five stats.

## Basic Moves
* When you do something relating to [specialty], add +1.
* When you do something relating to [stat], add +1.
* You have a [thing]. When applicable, it adds +1 to [stat] and [stat].
* You have the ability to [do some sort of active special power]. It counts as a basic move using [stat].
* You have [some passive special power that has a constant effect].

All actions are resolved by rolling 2d6. 
* 7 ~ 9: conditional success
* 10+: success

## Combat system for ship:

* Overheating, hacking, etc.

* Maneuvers, ship stats (armor, weapons, speed, agility)

* Crew will be in charge of different facets:
* Shielding sections (more protected and less protected sides, 6 sided die)
* Weapons - railgun (high damage, ½ chance) or ballistics (lower damage, ¾ chance)
* Evasion (no dmg <25, low dmg, high dmg >75)
* Hacking (if party gets -1, and enemy gets +1, no evasion, vice versa)
* Repairs (6 sided die, -1,0,+1 health)

* Every time crew loses one quarter health, someone rolls for personal injury

* All health lost, everyone rolls injury, ship is disabled and consequences are story/location based
